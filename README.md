# Field of Research Classification at NSLP2024
This repository contains our approaches for the Field of Research Classification (FoRC) Task which was conducted as a 
shared task within the [NSLP2024](https://nfdi4ds.github.io/nslp2024/docs/forc_shared_task.html) and 
[ESWC2024](https://2024.eswc-conferences.org/).

## Datasets
The datasets were provided by the challenge hosts under a CC-BY-4.0 license. The original datasets can be downloaded from Zenodo:
- [Validation dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10438530)
- [Testing dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/10469550)

Based on the original dataset, we provide a cleaned and slightly preprocessed dataset (with and without additional enrichments).

## Approaches
Our approaches described in the paper can be reproduced using the notebooks in the "notebooks" folder. If you use Colab, the imports and setup section at the top of the file installs all necessary packages. We also provide a requirements.txt file with pinned versions of all packages.
